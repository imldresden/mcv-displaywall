# Contribution Guide
There are a few rules to be aware:

## Workflow

1. **Use branches!** Instead of working on the master branch, we use feature branches.
2. **Use merge requests!** No merge without a merge request and a (short) review through another contributor.
This allows us to easily keep track of the development.
3. Use issues.
4. Write commit messages.
5. Be aware of good Python 2.7 style guides, e.g., https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.
Most important are rules as 2 space indentations.
